# Once fits are working locally (following README), you can run on lxbatch using these commands.

# This generates the commands to run. Change grid to whatever signal grid you want...

./ToolKit/backgroundbatch/generateOptimisationSRs.py 
./ToolKit/batch/generateOptimisationSRs.py --grid=GG_direct --entire-grid
./ToolKit/batch/generateOptimisationSRs.py --grid=SS_direct --entire-grid


# IF USING LXBATCH OR AN LSF SYSTEM:

  # This is a bit sloppy, but run the submission script in a "dry_run" mode to create the worker scripts
  # Run on the json file produced by the above command

  ./ToolKit/batch/runOptimisation.py -f optimisation/optimisation-XXXXXXX.json --dry_run

  # This thing is making scripts that aren't excecutable which pisses off lxbatch. So fix it with...

  chmod +x Jobs/*sh 

# FI


# Then you can submit it. 

./ToolKit/batch/runOptimisation.py -f optimisation/optimisation-XXXXXXXXX.json  # add a "--site=Oz" or "Columbia"
 or whatever if not running on LSF.

# Then you can convert these into json with

python makeJSON.py optimisation-XXXXXXXX/

# then there's a sensitivityFromJSON.py script in the plottingScripts directory that you can play with.
