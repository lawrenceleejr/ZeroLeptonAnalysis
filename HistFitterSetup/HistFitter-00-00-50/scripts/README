1. See:
HistFitter.py -usage 
for all HistFitter options.

==========================================================================================

Described below is a simple channel example, based on input histograms.
This can be used in combination with the example in :
macros/Examples/contourplot/README

2.
## To make root files containing the workspaces for grid point you want to assess.

## For example
HistFitter.py -w python/MySimpleChannelConfig.py

This config file:
python/MySimpleChannelConfig.py

... described a simple counting experiment in one bin, with:
- a JES uncertainty on the total bkg estimate and the signal estimate.
- a cross-section uncertainty on the signal estimate
- a luminosity uncertainty on the signal estimate

The signal estimates are given for 173 grid points in an msugra plane (tanb=3, A0=0).

The histograms for the background / signal / and error estimates are given in:
data/MySimpleChannelAnalysis.root

3.
## To extend this to a bin fitting simultaneously several bins, simply 
extend the number of bins in the input histograms, and change the python config to 
this number of bins.
