To-do-list HistFitter 17. February 2015

############
#All tasks:#
############


>>> High priority:

- Documentation on how to setup HistFitter and ROOT on different operating systems
- Document different types of systematic uncertainties (e.g. in tutorial and move material of talks to tutorial as well)
- Revision: the Tutorial/documentation could be a more practical-oriented. 
 o Add more advanced topics to the tutorial: Fitting with MINOS, systematic types, interpretation of fit failures, update contour plot example
 o Update FAQ and main HistFitter twiki pages
- Documentation: how to validate the fit? FAQ on failed fits. (stat forum)
- Advertizement and examples for combination of workspaces. ---> Partially DONE
- Migration into ATLAS release
- Harmonize the various plotting and batch/grid submission scripts. 
- Publication ---> Mostly done.
- Migrate to uncapped p0 values. 
- toys versus asymptotic
- FAQ on failed fits and how to handle them. Guideline on when a fit / grid-of-fits is okay.
- Possibility to reproduce fits during the hypothesis tests also outside of '-l' and '-p'
- Investigate 'method 3' from Higgs group for systematics tables
- Memory issue reported for loading many histograms at the grid by Katharina Behr

>>>>>From old to-do list:
- Bug in filling of weight based systematics --> Still valid?
- Remove MC statistical fluctuations from systematics (Max) 
- Proper treatment of all bins with zero events by HistFactory? Check (See recent mail George Lewis)
- sigma values in list-file. 
- Hard-coded names, e.g. sig_xsection. Needs to be documented, or made flexible. 
- Documentation needs cleanup. E.g Documentation of various available systematics. (David,Alex,Max)
- Generalized scripts --- for plotting in particular



>>> Next: Useful additions & Extra documentation:

- Analysis script sharing/generalization/
  o in particular for contour plot scripts, also update those in the trunk
  o add option to run contour plots to HistFitter.py
- Correct statistical treatment of fits to prescaled data. 
- Clean-up of C++ and python code (see work packages by statistics forum)
- Add possibility to produce HEPData material
- Add pull plot for parameters to HistFitter
- Provide functions/tools to do fitting/plotting of arbitrary workspaces, also not following the naming convention by HistFitter
- feature request: Need to change the buildHisto functionality to not providing a default starting value for the lowest bin, 
  as current default 0.0 is wrong for 'cuts' case. Instead, nBins, min, max should be given in future. Add in addition an if statement to catch unreasonable lower and upper bin values    for the 'cuts' case. ---> DONE.
- feature request: generalization of pull plot macro, possible based on pickle format as in Geert-Jan's example macro

>>> On slightly longer time-scale:

- Manpower situation. Rotation of mailing-list help. 
- Python code cleanup: implement polymorphic design for Systematic and Sample python config objects
