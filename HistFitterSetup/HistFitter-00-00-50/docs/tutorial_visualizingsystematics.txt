Visualizing systematic variations as input by the user is often a very helpful procedure to immediately see where systematic uncertainties look unexpected with respect to a nominal histogram. Weird systematic variations may lead to unstable fits or too a large, unexpected reduction of the originally put uncertainties. 

For these reasons, we introduce in this example two very simple (and in fact not yet very sophisticated) macros helping the user to visualize the impact of a systematic uncertainty with respect to a nominal histogram.

WARNING: As these macros are very simple, they are tuned very much to this specific example. You can easily rewrite them to your use case. On the longer time-scale we hope to integrate this functionality into the main HistFitter scripts.

Outgoing from the example above, we illustrate the effect that using =overallNormHistoSys= has on the size of systematic uncertainties. The two macros =scripts/plotSyst.C= and =scripts/plotUpDown.C= are already updated to this example above, such that they work really 'out-of-the-box'. (Don't hesitate to open both files to understand what the macros are doing and - eventually - to modify them according your needs.)

Just run now:

root scripts/plotSyst.C

This will create two plots, as you can also see in the calls in =scripts/plotSyst.C=. The one plot, =c_hTopJESHigh_SS_obs_metmeff2Jet_JES_metmeff2Jet.eps=, is showing the nominal =Top= background histogram in the signal region =SS= together with the up and down variations caused by the =JES= systematic uncertainty as originally input by the user or obtained from =-t=. The second plot, =c_hTopJESHigh_SS_obs_metmeff2JetNorm_JES_metmeff2Jet.eps=, is showing again the nominal histogram with the two up and down =JES= variations, but this time the =JES= uncertainty was normalized as described in the example above using the control regions =SLWR= and =SLTR= as normalization regions.

Comparing these two plots you clearly see the impact of reducing systematic uncertainties when using the transfer factor approach, so when using a normalized systematic uncertainties type.
