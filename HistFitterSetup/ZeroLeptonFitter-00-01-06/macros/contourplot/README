## To make contour plots, do the following:

## 1. make root files containing the workspaces for grid point you want to assess.
## --> Follow readme file in scripts/README
##     then move the root files here.

## For example
HistFitter.py -w python/MySimpleChannelConfig.py

## 2. Determing the exclusion CLs-value for all workspaces in each root file
##    (one workspace corresponds to one grid point)
##    The setting for the hypothesis test can be found in : python/MySimpleChannelConfig.py
##    In particular there 's the setting : configMgr.calculatorType=2
##    where 0 = toys, and 2 = asymptotic limits

HistFitter.py -p python/MySimpleChannelConfig.py

##    This produces a root file with hypothesis test results, at:
##    results/MySimpleChannelAnalysisOutput_hypotest.root

## 3. Convert the root file with hypo test results into a readable 'list' file.

cd macros/contourplots
root -b -q makelistfiles.C

##    this example produces two list text files with p-values, that can be read in in root
##    by doing : root -l summary_harvest_tree_description.h
##    which gives you a tree with the results

## 4. make contour histograms based on these list files

root -b -q makecontourhists.C 

## --> The underlying script used here is to make the histograms is : contourmacros/m0_vs_m12_nofloat.C

## 5. make final plots based on histograms

root -b -q makecontourplots.C

## --> The underlying script to make the plots is : contourmacros/SUSY_m0_vs_m12_all_withBand_cls.C
## the plots are stored under plots/


## For msugra plot with msq-mgl plane,
## After 3, swap m0->mgl, m12->msq in list

python ../../Toolkit/combination_mglmsq.py

## 5.make final plots 

root -b -q makecontourplots_glsq.C
